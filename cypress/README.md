### Test names should be written in present tense.

**Good Example**: _it('should render correctly')_<br />
**Bad Example**: _it('when we open the page component will render correctly')_

Good code can be read like a book, that is the standard that needs to be followed when writing tests.

### Elements selection

Elements should be selected with their **test id** as much as possible. There is a custom function already created for that usage.
